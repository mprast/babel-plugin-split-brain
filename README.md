# babel-plugin-split-brain
Easy, declarative code splitting with React and webpack. This should be installed along with split-brain.
This plugin in particular implements a JSX compilation stage that's supposed to go before JSX -> React. 
Go check out the [split-brain](https://github.com/mprast/split-brain) repo for info on how all of this works.
